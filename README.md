## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jamie

I'm a **software and system engineer** hailing from the **north-east of England**, in the **UK**. I currently work at Booking.com as a principal software engineer in Developer Experience, where I help our engineers build products better, quicker and safer. In the past I've worked at Tesco Bank and N-able, and ran my own system/software consultancy back in the day called HurstDEV.
